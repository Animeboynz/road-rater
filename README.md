# Road Rater

## Overview
**Road Rater** is a mobile app designed to provide a constructive and engaging outlet for drivers to rate and review the driving behavior of any registered vehicle in New Zealand. By using manual input or pattern recognition technology, users can enter a vehicle's number plate and leave a rating and review based on their encounter. The app promotes safer driving through a public master rating system, gamification elements, and dashcam integration.

## Features
- **Rate and Review Vehicles** â€“ Enter any registered NZ number plate and leave a rating with a short review.
- **Master Rating System** â€“ Every user has a credibility score that is displayed alongside their reviews and profile.
- **Dashcam & Visual Recognition** â€“ Integrate with dashcams and use phone cameras to identify vehicles in real-time.
- **Gamification** â€“ Earn badges and awards for maintaining high ratings; negative badges for low ratings.
- **Public Credibility Display** â€“ Driver ratings are visible, helping to promote accountability on the road.

## Potential Challenges & Solutions
### 1. Moderation of Reviews
   - Implement AI-powered content filtering to remove inappropriate or hateful comments.
   - Use community moderation and reporting systems for manual review.
   
### 2. Driver Safety
   - Restrict app usage while the vehicle is in motion, allowing interaction only when stationary.
   - Voice-command features to minimize distraction.

### 3. Transparency and Identity Verification
   - Require verified accounts to prevent anonymity and encourage accountability.
   - Link user profiles to registered vehicle ownership where applicable.
